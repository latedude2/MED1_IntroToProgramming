The rules of the game were inspired by the board game "Railroad Ink: Deep Blue Edition" created by Hjalmar Hach, Lorenzo Silva and Marta Tranquilli.

The goal of the game is to connect as many of the entrances marked by the green arrows. The maximum possible score is 11. A point is given for each new entrance connected to a road/track system. Example: if you have to seperate road systems, the maximum possible score becomes 10. Note: due to random generation of the tiles, the maximum score may be lower. 

To play, you can select the road/track tiles on the left side of the window. Here, you can also reverse and rotate the tiles to fit your needs. Then, you can place the selected tile on the board to the right of the tile selection. 

Roads can only be connected to tracks with stations which are the black squares in some tiles. You can only use the 4 given tiles each turn. Tiles that were placed this turn can be removed and be placed elsewhere if you change your mind, but once you press "Next turn", you will not be able to change your tile placements.

At any time you can skip to the next turn by pressing the "Next turn" button. This will also generate new tiles for you to use. Be careful though - you only have seven turns to complete your transport system. 

Your score and the current turn is shown at the bottom left corner of the window. 
The game is over once you use all of your tiles in turn 7.
